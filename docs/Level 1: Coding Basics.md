Here you can find links to programming tutorials which you will use in your Data Science Practice. They will tend focus more on the fundamentals of the programming languages (such as syntax) and help you get comfortable with code.

## Python
Python is a more general programming language which made its way into becoming a powerful Data Science tool because of its readability and simplicity.

## R
R is a programming language which has its roots in the sciences and research. Its extensive background in statistics and computation makes it another powerful Data Science tool.

## Python vs R
This is a question that is frequently asked. Many use both, some have strong preferences, and we don't want to say one is better than the other. These resources should help you which you might want to focus on or learn first!

## SQL
SQL (or Sequel) is the most widely used database querying structures. If you wanna get data from your company's database, it's likely going to require you to use SQL.
